 USA_earls_tour_desc:0 "Finally the Klan, the Republicans, the Anti Revolutionaries are all gone, the nation is now safe and at peace. The communist utopia America is destined to be can finally begin work. General Secretary Browder shall go on a tour of America to see where we need to start work on. From coast to coast and north to south he shall see every corner of the nation."
 usapr.1.d:1 "Today, Earl Browder set off on his tour of America. The grand cities of the nation shall all be visited by the General Secretary, from Los Angeles to Chicago to New York. His tour shall bring great joy to the people of the nation showing him as a true communist, for the people, looking where he can better our glorious society. Setting off from Philadelphia Airport on a DC-3 he struggles to decide where to go first with such great choice; The West Coast? The Greatlakes? The North East? \n\nOne thing is for certain though, the south will be the last place visited, a small but growing Klan movement is building up across the deep south. The General Secretary's advisors have warned him not to go to radical southern states with the fear of a possible terror attack or even an attempt on Browder's life. The Party is alert and ready to deal with more movement from the Klan. Suspicious fishing ships arriving from across the atlantic attempting to get past our defences are a sign that they are getting outside support but who from? The Brits? The Italians? God, maybe even the Germans?"

From the glory of Los Angeles and Hollywood to the mighty power of San Francisco with its' Golden Gate Bridge almost finished construction. The General Secretary visited many factories and trade unions across California before going to San Diego and seeing the navy. Browder is very proud of the American navy seeing it as a liberating revolutionary force with victories across the Pacific, holding the Japanese back from ever threatening the coast to landing in Siberia and liberating the workers on the Eastern Coast of Russia. Earl was very pleased with his trip, relatively calm and everyone in California seemed adapted to Socialism and the Communist Party USA's leadership"

 usapr.3.d:0 "The Greatlakes is the core of the American industry. Factories everywhere you look and dedicated masses of workers, it truly is the heart of American Socialism. From Chicago to Detroit massive industrial cities keep America alive. Earl Browder visited workers communes across the region helping to inspire locals. A very successful visit according to the general secretary. As he arrived at Chicago airport thousands of loyal socialist supporters lined up outside to greet him, a heartwarming show of support for the party. Earl has slowly built up a cult of personality only comparable to that of Hitler in Germany, a true dedication from his people and in return he does everything in his power to keep the people happy and successful. American socialism has greatly benefited the people here, giving them rights, allowing women to work, raising wages. America may be isolationist but one day when we break from our great cacoon we shall dominate the world and spread socialist ideals all over the atlantic and pacific."

Remnants of the old America, the NY Stock Exchange, the dilapidated trade ports and statues of slave owners and murderers. Work is still to be done in New York and New England, slowly American Communist ideals and policies are spreading into the region and consolidating themselves."
 usapr.4.d:0 "The North East, a glorious coast of skyscrapers and modern wonders of the world. From the Statue of Liberty to the rapidly Growing New York skyline. Cities like New York, Boston and Philadelphia have a strong anti communist presence and history. Statues and buildings of older eras show the flaws of the past America. The New York stock exchange, America's capital of capitalism, disgraceful. We must begin to reform the region into a shining beacon of socialism. Projects have began especially on the Statue of Liberty to convert it into examples of grand Communist ideals. The Statue of liberty now holds a Hammer and the Communist Manifesto, a slight difference but a way to portray the new America to the people of the north east. A strong democratic resistance has remained up here and it is now time to crackdown on it before it spreads into something unmanageable. Mafias in New York help fund this opposition and with fears of possible revolution the north east remains on our radar just incase things go sideways."

The almost empty streets of Texas show remnants of the 2nd Civil War, the battle against the insane Right Wings down in the deep south. Texas has been left abandoned by the Party, an unjust move but as punishment for their rebellious actions. Widespread purges against anti party politicians across the south has been focused in Texas at the moment. Many men imprisoned for their old actions. America maybe a free land but if you dare oppose the liberty of it, it shall rain hell upon you.\nNext up on the trip is to New Orleans..."

 usapr.6.d:0 "New Orleans, a lovely city, diverse and full of culture, truly wonderful. That was until 1924 of course and then seven years of civil war later and five years of instability brings us to now. An abandoned city, destroyed far beyond repair. Segregation at its most extreme, twenty times what it was before the war. New Orleans is a bloodbath, every man, women and even some children have firearms ready to defend themselves. It is a guerilla war without any conflict. Mafias from New York and Chicago have set up shop down here and a widespread drug trade has formed.\n\nAs the General Secretary drove through the streets of the city surrounded by only a few hundred supporters a man jumped out the dwindling crowd. He took two shots towards the General Secretary, both missing. Browder ducked down and soon the assassin was shot several times by the police. A worrying incident.\n\nThe final destination is Florida, the home of the Klan... a very dangerous place but Earl remains dedicated to completing his trip although the attempt on his life. A minor military presence shall follow the General Secretary through the streets of Jacksonville and Miami. "

Earl Browder drove through the town in a closed reinforced car trying to prevent any risk. Fifteen tanks escorted his car as a show of power and to the southerners that another attempt on the General Secretary's life. Not a single person walked along the main road, a ghost town. Through the many windows along the road people stare at Earl and many attempt to throw things at his car only to be scared off by the military.\n\nAs the General Secretary of the CPUSA entered the centre of the vicious city thirty Klan members armed with rifles and grenades ran out of a nearby cafe. Six grenades were thrown at Browder's car. An eerie silence and then *KABOOM* the General Secretary was killed along with his Wife and the Driver. The Army chase the men and some of the tanks fire at him. The General Secretary is dead.... America's great leader is dead...."

 social_democrat:0 "Social Liberalism"
 social_democrat_desc:0 "Social Liberalism is a variation on mainstream market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil liberties as basic human rights. Espousing progressive social and economic policies, the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of status. Social Liberalism stresses the social contract, under which citizens make the laws and agree to abide by those laws. It is based on the belief that individuals know best what is best for them. In theory Social Liberalism enfranchises all adult citizens regardless of sex, race, or economic status. Furthermore this 'social contract theory' has over time been elaborated to justify the need for democracy among 'liberals'. Additionally it also highlights that if a goverment fails to uphold the promises it made to "the governed," then the populace have the right and the duty to revolt with the purpose of imposing a new goverment, though as with any ideology there is little agreement among Social Liberal on what this promises are. Generally they are skeptical of any revolution which is not carried out to achieve the values of Social Liberalism. It generally supports a free-market capitalist economy, albiet with a few regulations. "

 ancap:0 "Anarcho-Capitalism"
 ancap_desc:0 "Anarcho-Capitalism is a political philosophy and economic theory that advocates the elimination of centralized states in favor of a system of private property enforced by private agencies, free markets and the right-libertarian interpretation of self-ownership, which extends the concept to include control of private property as part of the self. In the absence of statute, Anarcho-Capitalists hold that society tends to contractually self-regulate and civilize through participation in the free market which they describe as a voluntary society. In theory, Anarcho-Capitalist society would operate under a mutually agreed-upon legal code which would be generally accepted, and which the courts would pledge themselves to follow. This legal code would recognize contracts, private property, self-ownership and tort law in keeping with the non-aggression principle."

Embracing a laissez-faire approach to economy, Libertarians argue that only under a free market the individual can fully exercise their freedom, categorically condemning any form of collectivism or interventionism as tyranny. With its roots going as far back as Classical Liberalism of the Enlightenment the main currents of Libertariansm are the European political ideas connected to the Austrian School of Economics."

Deeply rooted in the belief of free will and laissez-faire capitalism, Objectivism states that governemnt is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control, thus serving as a legitimate and critically important institution in order to protect individual rights.

Adherents of this ideology fervently oppose any and all attempts by the state to promote gun control and rob them of their natural right to bear arms. They also reject both capitalism, communism, and fascism as being "destructive" statist institutions that hold little to no respect towards tradition whatsoever.

Sorelians oppose bourgeois democracy, the developments of the 18th century, the secular spirit, and the French Revolution, while supporting classical tradition. It stresses that the victory of the proletariat in class struggle could be achieved only through the power of myth and a general strike, thus resulting in the rejuvenation of both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. While rejecting, first on scientific and later on political grounds, the inevitability of capitalist collapse, and arguing against the possibility of laws of history in virtue of its agency-based view of social development, Sorelianism insists instead, on the institutional development of the proletariat, on the capacity of unions to become not only sites of resistance to capital, but more importantly spaces in which new, post-capitalist social relations could emerge. Despite its rather appealing rhetoric, however, some fring members hold deeply antisemitic and social Darwinian attitudes"

 anarchic_syndicalism_desc:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalism is a political philosophy and anarchist school of thought that views revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy and thus control influence in broader society. The end goal of syndicalism is to abolish the wage system, regarding it as wage slavery. Anarcho-syndicalist theory therefore generally focuses on the labour movement. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are solidarity, direct action (action undertaken without the intervention of third parties such as politicians, bureaucrats and arbitrators) and direct democracy, or workers' self-management. Anarcho-syndicalists believe their economic theories constitute a strategy for facilitating proletarian self-activity and creating an alternative co-operative economic system with democratic values and production that is centered on meeting human needs. Anarcho-syndicalists perceive the primary purpose of the state as the defense of private property in the forms of capital goods and therefore of economic, social and political privilege. In maintaining this status quo, the state denies most of its citizens the ability to enjoy material independence and the social autonomy that springs from it"

It rejects liberalism, communism, capitalism, and homosexuality as 'degenerate' in favor of a corporatist form of economy.

Julius Evola believed that society develops a 'regression of castes' where classes he viewed as superior were replaced by those he viewed as inferior. He believed that the rule of spiritual leaders (the highest class) was replaced by that of warriors (the second highest) then by merchants and finally by the proletariat (whom he described as 'spiritual eunuchs', quoting another philosopher). He believed that each aspect of society was effected by the dominant 'caste', for example, war in the first type was 'holy war' and in the second type 'defending the honour of one's lord'.

Although sharing similarities with National Socialism, it openly rejects due to its Turko-Slavic supremacist, anti-German rhetoric.

 oligarchism_desc:0 "Oligarchy is a form of power structure in which power rests with a small number of people. These people may or may not be distinguished by one or several characteristics, such as nobility, wealth, or military control. Governments under this ideology tend to manipulate the democratic process by means of rigged elections, bribery, and/or corruption to maintian power, but deeply oppose dictatorship and monarchy with equal disdain. According to the theorist Robert Michels, Oligarchy emerges when the necessary division of labor in large organizations leads to the establishment of a ruling class mostly concerned with protecting their own power."

 maoism_desc:0 "Maoism is a variety of Marxism–Leninism that Mao Zedong developed for realising a socialist revolution in the agricultural, pre-industrial society. The philosophical difference between Maoism and traditional Marxism–Leninism is that the peasantry are the revolutionary vanguard in pre-industrial societies rather than the proletariat. This updating and adaptation of Marxism–Leninism to Chinese conditions in which revolutionary praxis is primary and ideological orthodoxy is secondary represents urban Marxism–Leninism adapted to pre-industrial China."

 marxism3:0 "Democratic Marxism"
 marxism3_desc:0 "Democratic Marxism is a democratic variant of Marxism that emphasizes a synthesis between the dictatorship of the proletariat promoted by Marxism and the democratic values of free speech, free elections, and fair trial as sponsered by the United States Constitution. While seen by other variants of Marxism as revisionist, Democratic Marxism itself stresses that democracy is compatible to Marxism, arguing that the liberal forms of democracy had failed due to the supposed "oligarchical" nature of capitalism that was prevalenet within liberal states. With this in mind, Democratic Marxism can be best described as a kind of far-left interpretation of American democracy."

Founded by Leopold Averbach, it rejects the fascist rhetoric of National Eurasianism and views the ancient cultures of the Scythians, the Mongol Empire, and Pre-Christrian Slavs are the harbingers of the true proletarian faith. It is also an ideology that puts great emphasis on the importance of the peasantry in the overthrow of the capitalist system by the dictatorship of the proletariat and views agrarianism as superior to industrialized civilization. Within East Asia, adherents of Left Eurasianism also reject Hinduism and Buddhism as reactionary tools of oppression created by the aristocracy to pacify the workers and peasants within the region."

Being considered the “black sheep” among the communist movement, Gastevism argues that true communism can never be achieved without the proletariat completely rooting out any and all signs of traditionalism, capitalism, reactionism, and the past. Like Classical Futurism, despite the former’s inherent hatred towards Marxism, Gastevism seeks to implement an artistic, technological society centered around speed, violence, innovation, and modernity at all costs, albiet with a more proletarian vanguard approach towards achieving that aim. It also endorses a non-racial variant of eugenics in the hopes of genetically altering the human race to the point where they’ve gotten rid of any and all supposed defects such as homosexuality, blindness, mental illness, and other “defects,” thus achieving what it percieves as “true equality.” It also seeks to replace the institution of marriage with state-run selective breeding programs where families are created by party-arranged partnerships in order to ensure genetic purity within the working class. Marxist critics of Gastevism deem this ideology as a revisionist attempt to justify “technological utopianism.”"

The three principles are often translated into and summarized as nationalism, democracy, and the livelihood of the people. The Principle of Mínzú is commonly rendered as 'nationalism', literally 'Populism' or 'rule/government of the People', 'Mínzú/People' clearly describing a nation rather than a group of persons united by a purpose, hence the commonly used and rather accurate translation 'nationalism'. By this, Sun meant independence from imperialist domination or oppression. To achieve this he believed that China must develop a 'China-nationalism,' Zhonghua Minzu, as opposed to an 'ethnic-nationalism,' so as to unite all of the different ethnicities of China. The Principle of Mínquán is usually translated as 'democracy'; literally 'the People's power' or 'government by the People.' To Sun, it represented a Western constitutional government. The Principle of Mínshēng is sometimes translated as 'the People's welfare/livelihood,' 'Government for the People'. The concept may be understood as social welfare and as a direct criticism of the inadequacies of unregulated capitalism. Thus, Tridemism seeks a welfare capitalist economy based on Georgist principles."
